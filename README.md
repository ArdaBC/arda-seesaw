Features to implement:

Ball width and height proportional to weight

Random ball color


Current Bugs:

Sometimes, adding countertorque makes the seesaw move slightly in the other direction (probably an animation bug where the step is too slow, probably related to my /60 formula)

Seesaw moves before the weight touches the plank

After 20 balls, it gets really laggy

Sometimes, balls fall off to the side
