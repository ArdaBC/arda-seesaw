Features to implement:

Ball width and height proportional to weight

Random ball color

Total stats tracker

Logger

Current Bugs:

Sometimes, adding countertorque makes the seesaw move slightly in the other direction (probably an animation bug where the step is too slow, probably related to my /60 formula)

Seesaw moves before the weight touches the plank

Weights don't stop right on the plank
