Features to implement:

Ball width and height proportional to weight

Random ball color

Total stats tracker

Logger

Current Bugs:

Sometimes, adding countertorque makes the seesaw move slightly in the other direction (probably an animation bug where the step is too slow, probably related to my /60 formula)

Seesaw moves before the weight touches the plank

Sometimes, if the seesaw moves too fast, the collison logic on still balls fail and they hang on the air

After 20 balls, it gets really laggy

Sometimes, balls fall off to the side
